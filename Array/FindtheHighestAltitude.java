//https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/


There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. 
The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.
You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). 
Return the highest altitude of a point.

Example 1:

Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.

Example 2:

Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.

 

Constraints:

    n == gain.length
    1 <= n <= 100
    -100 <= gain[i] <= 100
*/

class Solution {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        int altitude = 0;
        int high_alt = -100;
        for(int i=0; i<gain.length; i++) {
            altitude += gain[i];
            if(altitude>high_alt) {
                high_alt = altitude;
            }
        }
        //it asked to return the altitude gained not the current altitude
        if(high_alt<0) {
            high_alt = 0;
        }
        return high_alt;
    }
}
